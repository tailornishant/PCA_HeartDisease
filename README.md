**Principal Component Analysis**
Cardiovascular disease prediction aids practitioners in making more accurate health decisions for their patients. Early detection can aid people in making lifestyle changes and, if necessary, ensuring effective medical care.

**Dataset columns:**

- age: The person’s age in years
- sex: The person’s sex (1 = male, 0 = female)
- cp: chest pain type
Value 0: asymptomatic
Value 1: atypical angina
Value 2: non-anginal pain
Value 3: typical angina
- trestbps: The person’s resting blood pressure (mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
- chol: The person’s cholesterol measurement in mg/dl
- fbs: The person’s fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl, 1 = true; 0 = false)
- restecg: resting electrocardiographic results
 Value 0: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes’ criteria
  Value 1: normal
  Value 2: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
- thalach: The person’s maximum heart rate achieved
- exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
- oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (‘ST’ relates to positions on the ECG plot. See more here)
- slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment — 0: downsloping; 1: flat; 2: upsloping
0: downsloping; 1: flat; 2: upsloping
- ca: The number of major vessels (0–3)
- thal: A blood disorder called thalassemia Value 0: NULL (dropped from the dataset previously
Value 1: fixed defect (no blood flow in some part of the heart)
Value 2: normal blood flow
Value 3: reversible defect (a blood flow is observed but it is not normal)
- target: Heart disease (1 = no, 0= yes)
